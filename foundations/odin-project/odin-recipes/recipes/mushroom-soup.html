        <h3>METHOD</h3>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and
          cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until softened. Add cup
          mushrooms. Cook, stirring for 5 minutes or until starting to soften.
          Add garlic. Cook for 1 minute or until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add stock and season with salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper.
          Bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes
          or until mushrooms are tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, melt half the butter in a large frypan over medium-high
          heat. Cook half of the Swiss mushrooms for 5 minutes or until golden.
          Transfer to a bowl. Repeat with remaining butter and Swiss mushrooms.
          Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a stick blender, carefully blend soup until very smooth. Stir in
          cream. Divide soup among serving bowls. Top with fried Swiss mushrooms
          and drizzle with extra olive oil. Season with freshly ground black
          pepper and serve sprinkled with thyme.
