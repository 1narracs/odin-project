        <p class="ingredients-subheader">Spice Mix</p>
        <li>15 cloves</li>
        <li>10 juniper berries</li>
        <li>5 star anise</li>
        <li>1 tsp fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 tsp allspice</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>METHOD</h3>
        <li>For the spice mix, preheat oven to 170°C.</li>
        <li>
          Combine all spices and place on a baking tray. Toast for 10 minutes or
          until fragrant, then cool completely. Whiz in a spice grinder or small
          food processor to a fine powder. Set aside. (Spice mix will keep in an
          airtight container for up to a month.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Place chicken livers, cream and brandy in a blender and whiz until
          smooth. Set aside. Combine minced venison, pork belly and back fat in
          the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add 1 tbs
          spice mix, orange zest, dried figs, thyme and 2 tbs table salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix on the lowest speed to just combine, then gradually add the liver
          mixture. Work the mixture until it becomes well combined and sticky -
          this should only take a minute. You don't want to over-work it, as
          it's nice to see the mosaic of mince in your finished terrine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 110°C. Line a 28cm x 13cm (2L-capacity) terrine mould
          with plastic wrap, allowing enough overhang to cover the top of your
          terrine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Press terrine mixture into the prepared mould, making sure it reaches
          all corners and that there are no air bubbles. Smooth the top evenly
          to form the shape of a baked loaf of bread.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fold the plastic wrap over on all four sides to seal the terrine, then
          tightly fit a sheet of foil over the top. This will help it keep a
          nice shape while cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place terrine in a deep roasting tray filled with enough water to come
          one-third of the way up the terrine mould. Transfer to oven and bake
          for 1 hour-1 hour 30 minutes until the internal temperature reaches
          63°C on a thermometer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully remove terrine from the water bath and cool for 30 minutes
          before chilling in the refrigerator for 12 hours or overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
          The next day, remove terrine from the mould and serve with fig jam,
          crusty bread, cornichons and very good French mustard alongside.
        </li>
