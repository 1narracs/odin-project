        <h3>METHOD</h3>
        <li>
          For the chilli sauce, place the fresh chillies, garlic and ginger in a
          food processor and whiz to a finely chopped paste. Heat the oil in a
          wok over medium-high heat. Add the chilli paste and stir-fry for 3
          minutes or until softened and aromatic. Stir in the brown sugar and
          cook for 1 minute or until the sugar has completely dissolved in the
          paste. Add the soy sauce and cook for 1 minute, then remove from the
          heat. Leave to cool, then transfer to a clean glass jar. Serve
          straight away or keep covered in the fridge for up to 1 week.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, heat the oil in a wok over high heat. Add the chilli sauce
          and stir-fry for just a few seconds to flavor the oil. Add the rice
          wine and cook for a few seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the black beans, soy sauce and 360ml water and bring to the boil.
          Add the mussels, cover the wok and cook for about 5 minutes or until
          the mussels start to open. Discard any that remain unopened.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir through half the coriander and remove from the heat. Transfer to
          a large bowl and scatter over the remaining coriander. Serve with the
          steamed rice.
